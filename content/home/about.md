# Hello!

I am currently a graduate student in the [Mathematics
Department](http://math.cofc.edu) at the [College of
Charleston](http://math.cofc.edu), working under the supervision of
[Ben Cox](http://coxbl.people.cofc.edu).  I am also a
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) engineer at [Seller
Labs](https://www.sellerlabs.com).

My current research project is in algebraic
[categorification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorification) and
higher representation theory, especially as it applies to questions in
[Lie theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_theory). I am also
interested in the applications of computers in pure mathematics
research, especially the open source mathematics software system
[Sage](http://www.sagemath.org), as well as the use of proof
assistants like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) and
[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io).
