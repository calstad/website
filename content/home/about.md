# Hello!

I am a masters student in the [Mathematics
Department](http://math.cofc.edu) at the [College of
Charleston](http://math.cofc.edu), working under the supervision of
[Ben Cox](http://coxbl.people.cofc.edu).  I am also a software
engineer at [PokitDok](https://pokitdok.com) where I work on projects
in machine learning, distributed cryptographic systems, formal
verification, and everything in between.

My current research focus is in the higher representation theory
of finite groups, specifically the categorification of the
representations of the dihedral and dicyclic groups.  I am also
interested in the applications of computers in pure mathematics
research, especially the open source mathematics software system
[Sage](http://www.sagemath.org), as well as the use of proof
assistants like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) and
[Lean](https://leanprover.github.io).
